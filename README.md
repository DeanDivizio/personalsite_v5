# Portfolio Site Round 5

## Goals

While I liked V4, I definitely felt like I had room to improve. 
- Responsiveness needed work. 
- My layouts were fine but not particularly refined. 
- I feel like my reliance on media and particle sims for the main aesthetic components made the site a little slower. 
- The content and overall presentation could be streamlined quite a bit in some ways and expanded on in others. 

Additionally, I really wanted an excuse to try using a shader for a background.

## The Stack
- Next.js
- Tailwind
- shadcn ui
- WordPress

## Going forward - as of 1/9/24
- Responsiveness needs a bit of work
- I'd like a full image gallery page in addition to the highlighted images section on the media page
