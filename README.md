# Portfolio Site Round 5

I don't think I really needed to update my site. V4 was pretty solid as-is. Sometimes I just can't help myself.

## Goals

While I liked V4, I definitely felt like I had room to improve. 
- Responsiveness needed work. 
- My layouts were fine but not particularly refined. 
- I feel like my reliance on media and particle sims for the main aesthetic components made the site a little slower. 
- The content and overall presentation could be streamlined quite a bit in some ways and expanded on in others. 

Additionally, I really wanted an excuse to try using a shader for a background.

## Process
### The stack
This project is based around Next.js. I'm using Tailwind for most of my CSS, shadcn components where needed, and WordPress for blog content management.

### The Design
I decided I wanted to go for a modern, flowy, XMB inspired design. I started by using [this shader](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/7slcWj) as a background component, modifying it slightly to blur the lines out a bit more and change the color in the corner to something within my palette. I then put that behind some blur and a gradient to both improve the readability of the text that sits on top, and give it more directionality overall.
